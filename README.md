# LightpickerMacro
An updated, improved, and much more complicated version of FoundryVTT's community macro "lightpicker" https://github.com/foundry-vtt-community/macros/blob/main/token/light_picker.js

The original was published under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0), which requires that adaptations be published under the same license.
For that reason I've given this that same license.
You are allowed to take, adapt, and improve my amateur code, just like I was with the original under the same license.

Hope it helps someone!
